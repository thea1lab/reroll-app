## Reroll — Product Concept Document

### Overview

**Reroll** is a mobile application focused on simplifying cooking decisions through organized recipe groups and randomized selection.

The core idea is to eliminate indecision by allowing users to organize their own recipes and instantly receive a random suggestion based on context, meal type, or difficulty level.

The application prioritizes simplicity, visual appeal, and engaging interaction.

---

## Core User Flow

### 1. Entry Experience

When opening Reroll, the user does **not** immediately see recipes.

Instead, the first screen displays **Recipe Groups**.

Examples:

* Breakfast
* Lunch
* Dinner
* Desserts
* Snacks
* Weekend Meals
* Custom Groups created by the user

These groups act as containers that organize cooking moments rather than individual dishes.

---

### 2. Groups System

Users can:

* Create groups
* Rename groups
* Add recipes inside groups
* Organize recipes according to lifestyle or routine

Each group represents a decision context:

> *“What should I cook for this moment?”*

---

### 3. Recipe Management

Inside a group, users will see recipes they previously added.

Each recipe contains:

* Recipe name
* Ingredients
* Preparation steps
* Estimated preparation time
* Difficulty level

Users fully control their recipe collection.

---

### 4. Difficulty Levels

Recipes are categorized into three preparation levels:

| Level  | Description                                        |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy   | Quick meals, minimal preparation                   |
| Medium | Standard meals (~1–2 hours)                        |
| Hard   | Complex recipes requiring planning and preparation |

Before randomizing, users may optionally filter by difficulty.

---

### 5. Random Selection (Core Feature)

Inside any group, users can press **Reroll**.

The system will:

* Randomly select one recipe from that group
* Respect selected difficulty filters (if applied)
* Present a clear cooking suggestion

If the user is not satisfied, they can reroll again instantly.

Primary interaction:

> Select group → Reroll → Cook.

## Interface & Design Principles

### Simplicity First

The interface must remain:

* Minimal
* Clean
* Easy to understand
* Low cognitive effort

Navigation depth should remain shallow.

---

### Visual Direction

The design should feel:

* Warm
* Inviting
* Playful
* Visually attractive

Target audience prioritization:

* Women who enjoy cooking
* Casual home cooks
* Users seeking inspiration rather than planning tools

---

### Animation Philosophy

Animations are essential to engagement.

Recommended characteristics:

* Smooth transitions
* Soft motion
* Rewarding reroll animation
* Playful feedback when a recipe is selected

The reroll action should feel entertaining, similar to revealing a surprise.

---

It is a **decision assistant**.

The app shifts the experience from:

to:

> organizing and discovering.

---

> *“What should I cook today?”*

with a single action:

> **Reroll.**
